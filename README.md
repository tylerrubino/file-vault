# file-vault

file-vault is a secure and user-friendly file sharing and storage web application. Designed to handle file uploads, sharing between users, and secure authentication, it provides a robust platform for managing your files online.

The inspiration behind this project was in regards to how I was sharing files between my devices. Consistently using a private discord server to share compressed files and school assignments was beginning to become impractical, and being a CS major, simply using an already existing file sharing system was not practical enough apparently.

## Features

### Backend

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with hashed passwords and JWT-based authentication.
- **File Management**: Upload, delete, download, and view files with a clean and responsive UI.
- **File Sharing**: Owners can share files with other registered users and manage access.
- **Access Revocation**: Owners can revoke access for specific users, and shared users can remove their own access.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Socket.io integration to notify users of updates, such as new uploads or access changes.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js & Express**: Server and API framework.
- **SQLite**: Database for storing metadata, such as user and file information.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time notifications.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication.
- **Multer**: File-uploads.

### Frontend

- **React**: User interface framework.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components and creating responsive layouts.
- **Axios**: For API communication.
- **React Router**: For navigation.

## Usage Notes

This project uses **JTW authentication** for secure access to API endpoints. Make sure to include a valid token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`) when making requests to protected routes.

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Storage**: Integration with AWS S3 or Google Cloud for file storage.
- **Database Migration**: Potential migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability.
- **Enhanced Frontend UI**: A clean and responsive React interface using Tailwind CSS.
